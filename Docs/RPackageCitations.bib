	abstract = {Sea-level rise has been threatening the terrestrial ecosystem functioning of coastal islands, of which the most important component is carbon (C) cycling. However, metagenomic and metabolomic evidence documenting salt intrusion effects on molecular biological processes of C cycling are still lacking. Here, we investigated microbial communities, metagenomic taxonomy and function, and metabolomic profiles in the marine-terrestrial transition zone of low- and high-tide, and low- and high-land areas based on distances of 0 m, 50 m, 100 m, and 200 m, respectively, to the water-land junction of Neilingding Island. Our results showed that soil salinity (EC) was the dominant driver controlling bacterial abundance and community composition and metagenomic taxonomy and function. The metabolomic profiling at the low-tide site was significantly different from that of other sites. The low-tide site had greater abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes (1.6–3.7 fold), especially Gammaproteobacteria, but lower abundance (62–83\%) of Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi, compared with other three sites. The metagenomic functional genes related to carbohydrate metabolism decreased at the low-tide site by 15.2\%, including the metabolism of aminosugars, di- and oligo-saccharides, glycoside hydrolases, and monosaccharides, leading to significant decreases in 21 soil metabolites, such as monosaccharide (l-gulose), disaccharide (sucrose and turanose), and oligosaccharides (stachyose and maltotetraose). Our study demonstrates that elevated salinity due to sea-level rise may suppress C-cycling genes and their metabolites, therefore having negative impacts on microbial metabolism of organic matter.},

	abstract = {A thorough sampling of maple, oak, birch, and apple tree bark in North America yielded a set of isolates that represent a yeast species not yet formally described. The strains obtained were all isolated from the Canadian province of Québec. These four isolates have identical electrophoretic karyotypes, distinct from other species of the genus
              Lachancea
              , and are most closely related to the formally recognized species
              Lachancea thermotolerans
              according to the D1/D2 domain of the LSU rDNA gene and 5.8S–ITS region. Previous studies revealed the existence of a population of strains closely related to
              L. thermotolerans,
              with unique D1/D2 sequences and the ability to grow on melibiose, which is also true for these isolates. The sequences obtained here (for the D1/D2, and 5.8S–ITS region) are identical among the four strains, and in a phylogenetic analysis of the D1/D2 region, the strains form a distinct clade with the previously described population closely related to
              L. thermotolerans
              , composed of isolates from Japan, as well as from the provinces of Ontario and Québec in Canada. On the basis of select physiological and phylogenetic characteristics, a novel ascosporogenous yeast species,

Two isolates of potent PLA-degrading bacteria, designated as CH1 and WS3, were selected and identified as Stenotrophomonas pavanii and Pseudomonas geniculata, respectively. PLA was presented as a substrate to stimulate production of protease and PLA-degrading enzyme by S. pavanii CH1 and P. geniculata WS3. The optimal pH values for both protease and PLA-degrading enzyme production by S. pavanii CH1 and P. geniculata WS3 were 7.5 and 8.0, respectively. The optimal gelatin concentrations for stimulating protease production in S. pavanii CH1 and P. geniculata WS3 were 0.3\% (w/v), while those for PLA-degrading enzyme production in S. pavanii CH1 and P. geniculata WS3 were 0.1 and 0.3\% (w/v), respectively. In addition, P. geniculata WS3 had a higher percentage of PLA film-weight loss than that of S. pavanii CH1, corresponding with reduced molecular weight of PLA. A significant increase of lactic acid content in culture broth was directly correlated with the increasing percentage of PLA film-weight loss. Our results clearly demonstrated that P. geniculata WS3, a novel isolated bacterium, has played a substantial role in PLA biodegradation by producing PLA-degrading enzyme and adhering on PLA surface.},

	abstract = {Bio-plastics have gained tremendous attention, due to the increasing environmental pressure on global warming and plastic pollution. Among them, poly (lactic acid) (PLA) is both bio-based and bio-degradable, which has been widely used in many disposable packaging applications. The global market for PLA demand doubles every 3–4 years, as estimated by Jem's law. Compared to traditional petroleum-based plastics, PLA is more expensive and usually has less mechanical and physical properties. The recent compounding efforts and the commercialization of D(−) lactic acid and its polymer PDLA have the potential to improve the mechanical and thermal characteristics of PLA (e.g. by forming stereocomplex PLA) for applications in high-end markets. However, the usage of PLA in some other applications is still limited. With a structure similar to PLA, poly (glycolic acid) (PGA) has promising characteristics such as good biodegradability and barrier properties, which is potentially a beneficial supplement to PLA. The modification of PLA with PGA can be achieved via co-polymerization, physical blending and multilayer lamination. PGA and its combination with PLA have been widely studied in bio-medical applications, but not been well developed at large scales due to its relatively high production cost. In this case, the development of novel production technology and the advent of government regulations are the key drivers for the global transition towards bioplastics. Recently, multiple governmental regulations have been released that restrict the use of traditional plastics and facilitate bio-degradable plastic applications. PGA can be derived from industrial waste gases using an innovative production technology, which reduces carbon emissions and its production cost. By developing the production and compounding technology, PGA can be combined with PLA to play an essential role for a sustainable and environmental friendly plastic industry, especially for single-used products requiring fast degradation at room temperature or in the nature environment.},

Their growth and formation of biofilm on PLA was characterized. To establish the biodegradation role of these bacteria and to assess any possible influence of abiotic factors in the biodegradation of PLA at 30 °C, the biodegradation rate of each strain was measured as the reduction of weight average molecular number (Mn) of PLA. A rapid reduction of PLA Mn was observed when incubated with each strain. Abiotic controls showed very slow degradation rates. Only the P. aeruginosa isolates were able to grow on lactate suggesting that there is a novel mechanism for degradation by Chryseobacterium sp. and Sphingobacterium sp. All four strains were capable of forming biofilm on the surface of PLA films consistent with the observed polymer degradation. This comparative study establishes the role of these isolates in the degradation of PLA at ambient temperature with minimal assistance from abiotic factors.},

	abstract = {Polylactic acid (PLA) is the most commonly used biodegradable polymer in clinical applications today. Examples range from drug delivery systems, tissue engineering, temporary and long-term implantable devices; constantly expanding to new fields. This is owed greatly to the polymer's favorable biocompatibility and to its safe degradation products. Once coming in contact with biological media, the polymer begins breaking down, usually by hydrolysis, into lactic acid (LA) or to carbon dioxide and water. These products are metabolized intracellularly or excreted in the urine and breath. Bacterial infection and foreign-body inflammation enhance the breakdown of PLA, through the secretion of enzymes that degrade the polymeric matrix., The biodegradation occurs both on the surface of the polymeric device and inside the polymer body, by diffusion of water between the polymer chains., The median half-life of the polymer is 30 weeks; however, this can be lengthened or shortened to address the clinical needs. Degradation kinetics can be tuned by determining the molecular composition and the physical architecture of the device. Using L- or D- chirality of the LA will greatly slow or lengthen the degradation rates, respectively., Despite the fact that this polymer is more than 150 years old, PLA remains a fertile platform for biomedical innovation and fundamental understanding of how artificial polymers can safely coexist with biological systems.},

Four coliforms (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae) were isolated from an operating drinking water system for study; an enterotoxigenic E. coli strain and clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae and E. coli were also used. All but one of the coliforms tested were capable of growth in unsupplemented mineral salts medium; the environmental isolates had greater specific growth rates than did the clinical isolates. This trend was maintained when the organisms were grown with low levels (less than 1 mg liter-1) of yeast extract. The environmental K. pneumoniae isolate had a greater yield, higher specific growth rates, and a lower Ks value than the other organisms. The environmental E. coli and the enterotoxigenic E. coli strains had comparable yield, growth rate, and Ks values to those of the environmental K. pneumoniae strain, and all three showed significantly more successful growth than the clinical isolates. The environmental coliforms also grew well at low temperatures on low concentrations of yeast extract. Unsupplemented distribution water from the collaborating utility supported the growth of the environmental isolates. Growth of the K. pneumoniae water isolate was stimulated by the addition of autoclaved biofilm but not by tubercle material. These findings indicate that growth of environmental coliforms is possible under the conditions found in operating municipal drinking water systems and that these bacteria could be used in tests to determine assimilable organic carbon in potable water.},

Accurate and rapid detection of resistance to antimicrobial drugs, and subsequent appropriate antimicrobial treatment, combined with antimicrobial stewardship, are essential for controlling the emergence and spread of AMR. This article reviews common antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) methods and relevant issues concerning the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Although accurate, classic technologies used in clinical microbiology to profile antimicrobial susceptibility are time-consuming and relatively expensive. As a result, physicians often prescribe empirical antimicrobial therapies and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Although recently developed AST systems have shown advantages over traditional methods in terms of testing speed and the potential for providing a deeper insight into resistance mechanisms, extensive validation is required to translate these methodologies to clinical practice. With a continuous increase in antimicrobial resistance, additional efforts are needed to develop innovative, rapid, accurate, and portable diagnostic tools for AST. The wide implementation of novel devices would enable the identification of the optimal treatment approaches and the surveillance of antibiotic resistance in health, agriculture, and the environment, allowing monitoring and better tackling the emergence of AMR.},

	abstract = {: Antifungal susceptibility testing is an important tool for managing patients with invasive fungal infections, as well as for epidemiological surveillance of emerging resistance. For routine testing in clinical microbiology laboratories, ready-to-use commercial methods are more practical than homemade reference techniques. Among commercially available methods, the concentration gradient Etest strip technique is widely used. It combines an agar-based diffusion method with a dilution method that determinates a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in µg/mL. Many studies have evaluated the agreement between the gradient strip method and the reference methods for both yeasts and filamentous fungi. This agreement has been variable depending on the antifungal, the species, and the incubation time. It has also been shown that the gradient strip method could be a valuable alternative for detection of emerging resistance (non-wild-type isolates) as Etest epidemiological cutoff values have been recently defined for several drug-species combinations. Furthermore, the Etest could be useful for direct antifungal susceptibility testing on blood samples and basic research studies (e.g., the evaluation of the in vitro activity of antifungal combinations). This review summarizes the available data on the performance and potential use of the gradient strip method.},

	abstract = {In an extensive, multiyear study of antibiotic resistance from wastewater oxidation ponds, five mobile home park wastewater oxidation ponds in Clarke and Oconee counties were shown to be discharging high numbers of antibiotic‐resistant bacteria into the waterways of North Georgia. This effluent contributed to higher nitrogen, phosphorus, and fecal coliform levels in creeks downstream from the ponds. A survey of residents revealed that many people did not complete their antibiotic prescriptions, and the majority flushed leftover antibiotic medications down the toilet. In the pond discharges, resistance was found to eighteen antibiotics: amikacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, apramycin, cefoxitin, ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, kanamycin, naladixic acid, streptomycin, sulphamethoxazole, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, and tetracycline.    The discharged bacteria contained both integrons and plasmids, the latter being transferable to a laboratory strain of Escherichia coli (E. coli). A turtle was found living at a pond discharge site with multiply‐antibiotic‐resistant bacteria in its feces. Last year, RNA fingerprinting conclusively documented the survival of three multiply‐resistant important pathogenic bacteria. Ceftriaxone‐resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Pseudomonas aerogenosa and a ciprofloxacin‐resistant E. coli were traced through oxidation pond stages and into the discharge, thus documenting that the pathogens survived the treatment process. In addition, a potential pathogen, a serotype group D Salmonella
              spp
              ., was found in the discharge.    In this study, tetracycline‐resistance genes C and G were detected in the first and second stages of the oxidation pond and the discharge went directly into the environment. These genes are generally found in intestinal bacteria, so it can be inferred that they are from a human source. Antimicrobial residue from the beta‐lactam family of antibiotics was found in all oxidation pond stages and in the creek above the pond. Tetracycline residue was found in the first and second stages of the pond. In addition to the antibiotics, genes coding for antibiotic resistance and the antibiotics themselves were documented to survive oxidation pond treatment. Tetracycline‐resistant genes were identified in the oxidation pond stages and in the discharge going into the environment.    A model was also developed to study oxidation pond function in the laboratory. A biofilm was created using a highly antibiotic‐resistant Salmonella typhimurium
              3/97
              , and pond water was added. The biofilm was processed via a rotating disk bioreactor specifically designed to study biofilms in nature, but with conditions that were more favorable to bacterial inhibition than those in nature. Cultures revealed that, under these optimal conditions, S. typhimurium
              3/97
              was still present in this
              in vitro
              system. Thus, the competitive inhibition process that helps to remove bacteria in oxidation ponds did not effectively remove an important bacterium, S. typhimurium 3/97, in this mock oxidation pond.    The bioreactor model developed in this study can be used to further investigate discharges from oxidation ponds. From this data, it is apparent that the problem is two‐fold. A cost‐effective technique must be developed that inactivates antibiotic‐resistant bacteria in oxidation pond discharges and also removes the antibiotics. A public awareness campaign was initiated by the author to encourage proper use and disposal of antibiotics, as flushing them is a common practice in the United States.},

	abstract = {Introduction The occurrence of antibiotic resistance in faecal bacteria in sewage is likely to reflect the current local clinical resistance situation. Aim This observational study investigated the relationship between Escherichia coli resistance rates in sewage and clinical samples representing the same human populations. Methods E. coli were isolated from eight hospital (n = 721 isolates) and six municipal (n = 531 isolates) sewage samples, over 1 year in Gothenburg, Sweden. An inexpensive broth screening method was validated against disk diffusion and applied to determine resistance against 11 antibiotics in sewage isolates. Resistance data on E. coli isolated from clinical samples from corresponding local hospital and primary care patients were collected during the same year and compared with those of the sewage isolates by linear regression. Results E. coli resistance rates derived from hospital sewage and hospital patients strongly correlated (r2 = 0.95 for urine and 0.89 for blood samples), as did resistance rates in E. coli from municipal sewage and primary care urine samples (r2 = 0.82). Resistance rates in hospital sewage isolates were close to those in hospital clinical isolates while resistance rates in municipal sewage isolates were about half of those measured in primary care isolates. Resistance rates in municipal sewage isolates were more stable between sampling occasions than those from hospital sewage. Conclusion Our findings provide support for development of a low-cost, sewage-based surveillance system for antibiotic resistance in E. coli, which could complement current monitoring systems and provide clinically relevant antibiotic resistance data for countries and regions where surveillance is lacking.},

	abstract = {Diel primary production patterns of intertidal microphytobenthos (MPB) have been attributed to short-term physiological changes in the photosynthetic apparatus or to diel changes in the photoautotrophic biomass in the sediment photic layer due to vertical migration. Diel changes in primary production and vertical migration are entrained by external factors like photoperiod and tides. However, the role of photoperiod and tides has not been experimentally separated to date. Here, we performed laboratory experiments with sediment cores kept in immersion, in the absence of tides, with photoperiod or under continuous light. Measurements of net production, made with O2 microsensors, and of spectral reflectance at the sediment surface showed that, in intertidal sediments, the photoperiod signal was the major driver of the diel patterns of net primary production and sediment oxygen availability through the vertical migration of the MPB photoautotrophic biomass. Vertical migration was controlled by an endogenous circadian rhythm entrained by photoperiod in the absence of tides. The pattern progressively disappeared after 3 days in continuous light but was immediately reset by photoperiod. Even though a potential contribution of a subjective in situ tidal signal cannot be completely discarded, Fourier and cross spectral analysis of temporal patterns indicated that the photosynthetic circadian rhythm was mainly characterized by light/dark migratory cycles.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Soil salinization caused by sea level rise threatens coastal agricultural soils and geochemically important wetlands worldwide. The aim of this review is to outline expected changes in soil biological activity by discussing the combined effects of salt stress and flooding on plants productivity and soil microbial communities, which determine consequences on fluxes of C, N and P. Finally, it outlines the expected repercussions on greenhouse gases emissions. The prediction of outcomes is made difficult by the concomitant and sometimes contrasting actions of flooding and seawater intrusion on partly acclimated and non-acclimated environments. Non-salt acclimated plants suffer from osmotic stress, but also from reduced O$_{\textrm{2}}$ solubility. Microbial biomass declines with increasing salinity and microbial communities shift in composition. Large concentrations of Cl$^{\textrm{−}}$ inhibit nitrification, but salinity stimulates N$_{\textrm{2}}$O fluxes. Impacts on C mineralisation rates is variable but enhanced by the larger availability of terminal electron acceptors. The reduction of Fe combined with that of SO$_{\textrm{4}}$$^{\textrm{2−}}$ could enhance P mobility. Salinization affects methanogenesis which is constrained in favour of SO$_{\textrm{4}}$$^{\textrm{2−}}$ reduction. Consequences are largely site specific and difficult to predict because of the complex network of processes occurring simultaneously in different compartments (i.e., soil, microbiome, vegetation). The distinction between short and long term effects is also important. A reliable prediction of outcomes at a planetary scale will only result from more precise inventories and monitoring of areas displaying specific similarities and from the implementation from these well-defined data sets of specifically devised models whose results can be finally combined on a weighted basis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Aquatic ecosystems are often stratified, with cyanobacteria in oxic layers and phototrophic sulfur bacteria in anoxic zones. Changes in stratification caused by the global environmental change are an ongoing concern. Increasing understanding of how such aerobic and anaerobic microbial communities, and associated abiotic conditions, respond to multifarious environmental changes is an important endeavor in microbial ecology. Insights can come from observational and experimental studies of naturally occurring stratified aquatic ecosystems, theoretical models of ecological processes, and experimental studies of replicated microbial communities in the laboratory. Here, we demonstrate a laboratory‐based approach with small, replicated, and liquid‐dominated Winogradsky columns, with distinct oxic/anoxic strata in a highly replicable manner. Our objective was to apply simultaneous global change scenarios (temperature, nutrient addition) on this micro‐ecosystem to report how the microbial communities (full‐length 16S rRNA gene seq.) and the abiotic conditions (O2, H2S, TOC) of the oxic/anoxic layer responded to these environmental changes. The composition of the strongly stratified microbial communities was greatly affected by temperature and by the interaction of temperature and nutrient addition, demonstrating the need of investigating global change treatments simultaneously. Especially phototrophic sulfur bacteria dominated the water column at higher temperatures and may indicate the presence of alternative stable states. We show that the establishment of such a micro‐ecosystem has the potential to test global change scenarios in stratified eutrophic limnic systems., We used a modified and highly replicated Winogradsky column approach for analyzing simultaneous global change effects (temperature and nutrient addition) on aquatic stratified microbial communities. We found that these global change treatments can have interaction effects and can differ between the oxic and anoxic layers and the community within.},

Environmental gradients develop within the column creating diverse niches that allow enrichment of specific bacteria. The enrichment culture can be used to study soil and sediment microbial community structure and function. In this study we used a 16S rRNA gene survey to characterize the microbial community dynamics during Winogradsky column development to determine the rate and extent of change from the source sediment community. Over a period of 60 days, the microbial community changed from the founding pond sediment population: Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Nitrospirae, and Planctomycetes increased in relative abundance over time, while most Proteobacteria decreased in relative abundance. A unique, light-dependent surface biofilm community formed by 60 days that was less diverse and dominated by a few highly abundant bacteria. 67–72\% of the surface community was comprised of highly enriched taxa that were rare in the source pond sediment, including the Cyanobacteria Anabaena, a member of the Gemmatimonadetes phylum, and a member of the Chloroflexi class Anaerolinea. This indicates that rare taxa can become abundant under appropriate environmental conditions and supports the hypothesis that rare taxa serve as a microbial seed bank. We also present preliminary findings that suggest that bacteriophages may be active in the Winogradsky community. The dynamics of certain taxa, most notably the Cyanobacteria, showed a bloom-and-decline pattern, consistent with bacteriophage predation as predicted in the kill-the-winner hypothesis. Time-lapse photography also supported the possibility of bacteriophage activity, revealing a pattern of colony clearance similar to formation of viral plaques. The Winogradsky column, a technique developed early in the history of microbial ecology to enrich soil microbes, may therefore be a useful model system to investigate both microbial and viral ecology.},

	abstract = {Vermicomposting – the production of fertilizers and bioactive substrates for plants using soil oligochaetes – is an actively developing area of agricultural technology. Beneficial properties of vermicompost are provided, for the most part, by communities of bacteria that live in the digestive system of the worm and process the incoming substrate. Moreover, in light of modern trends towards biorecultivation a closest attention is paid to the ability of earthworms' microbial communities to transform organic waste from agricultural or other industries substrates into vermicompost. The aim of our study was to analyze the microbiota of the widespread soil oligochaete Eisenia fetida cultivated on commercial peat and sludge obtained from water treatment plants. Using metagenomic sequencing, we analyzed the dynamics of microbiome in digestive system of the worm during the vermicomposting. The diversity of bacteria in sludge was significantly higher than in peat. The diversity of the microbiome during vermicomposting of peat remained relatively stable compared to sewage sludge. We revealed that Eisenia fetida may absorb most of the bacteria living in the substrate in which the worms were cultivated. Most of the engulfed bacteria pass through the worm's digestive system and return to the substrate; however, part of them might be digested by the worm or remain in the gut as a functional part of its microbiome. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla in the earthworm gut microbial communities, regardless of the cultivation substrate. We also demonstrated the possible autochthonous microbiome of Eisenia fetida, including at least 11 genera. A stable bacterial set (including Bacillus sp., Bradyrhizobium sp., Cupriavidus sp., Cutibacterium sp., Leifsonia sp., Paeniclostridium sp., Roseomonas sp., Sphingomonas sp., Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., and Trichococcus sp.) was registered as common for the empty guts of Eisenia fetida cultivated in peat and sludge. These core bacteria may play a key role in the vermicomposting process and bioremediation, especially in such disturbed substrates as wastewater sludge, being introduced by the earthworm itself.},

	abstract = {Waste management strategies for organic residues, such as composting and vermicomposting, have been implemented in some developed and developing countries to solve the problem of organic solid waste (OSW). Yet, these biological treatment technologies do not always result in good quality compost or vermicompost with regards to sanitation capacity owing to the presence of bacterial pathogenic substances in objectionable concentrations. The presence of pathogens in soil conditioners poses a potential health hazard and their occurrence is of particular signiﬁcance in composts and/or vermicomposts produced from organic materials. Past and present researches demonstrated a high-degree of agreement that various pathogens survive after the composting of certain OSW but whether similar changes in bacterial pathogenic loads arise during vermitechnology has not been thoroughly elucidated. This review garners information regarding the status of various pathogenic bacteria which survived or diffused after the composting process compared to the status of these pathogens after the vermicomposting of OSW with the aim of achieving sanitation goals. This work is also indispensable for the speciﬁcation of compost quality guidelines concerning pathogen loads which would be speciﬁc to treatment technology. It was hypothesized that vermicomposting process for OSW can be efﬁcacious in sustaining the existence of pathogenic organisms most speciﬁcally; human pathogens under safety levels. In summary, earthworms can be regarded as a way of obliterating pathogenic bacteria from OSW in a manner equivalent to earthworm gut transit mechanism which classiﬁes vermicomposting as a promising sanitation technique in comparison to composting processes.},

The aim of this study was to compare low-technology solutions such as composting and lactic acid fermentation (LAF) followed by vermicomposting in terms of treatment efficiency, potential human and environmental risks, and stabilization of the material for reuse in agriculture. A specific and novel focus of the study was the fate of native pharmaceutical compounds in the fecal matter. Composting, with and without the addition of biochar, was monitored by temperature and CO2 production and compared with LAF. All treatments were run at three different ambient temperatures (7, 20, and 38°C) and followed by vermicomposting at room temperature. Materials resulting from composting and LAF were analyzed for fecal indicators, physicochemical characteristics, and residues of ten commonly used pharmaceuticals and compared to the initial substrate. Vermicomposting was used as secondary treatment and assessed by enumeration of Escherichia coli, worm density, and physicochemical characteristics. Composting at 38°C induced the highest microbial activity and resulted in better stability of the treated material, higher N content, lower numbers of fecal indicators, and less pharmaceutical compounds as compared to LAF. Even though analysis of pH after LAF suggested incomplete fermentation, E. coli cell numbers were significantly lower in all LAF treatments compared to composting at 7°C, and some of the anionic pharmaceutical compounds were detected in lower concentrations. The addition of approximately 5 vol \% biochar to the composting did not yield significant differences in measured parameters. Vermicomposting further stabilized the material, and the treatments previously composted at 7°C and 20°C had the highest worm density. These results suggest that in small-scale decentralized sanitary facilities, the ambient temperatures can significantly influence the treatment and the options for safe reuse of the material.},

	abstract = {Quantifying spatial variability in intertidal benthic productivity is necessary to guide management of estuaries and to understand estuarine ecological processes, including the amount of benthic organic carbon available for grazing, burial and transport to the pelagic zone. We developed a model to assess microphytobenthic (MPB) primary production using (1) remotely sensed information on MPB biomass and remotely sensed information on sediment mud content, (2) surface irradiance and ambient temperature (both from local meteorological observations), (3) directly-measured photosynthetic parameters and (4) a tidal model. MPB biomass was estimated using the normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) and mud content was predicted using surface reflectance in the blue and near-infrared, both from Landsat 8 satellite imagery. The photosynthetic capacity (maximum photosynthesis rate normalized to MPB chl-a) was estimated from ambient temperature, while photosynthetic efficiency and the light saturation parameter were derived from in situ fluorometry-based production measurements (PAM). The influence of tides (submergence by turbid water) on MPB production was accounted for in the model. The method was validated on several locations in two temperate tidal basins in the Netherlands (Oosterschelde and Westerschelde). Model based production rates (mg C m−2 h−1) matched well with an independent set of in situ (PAM) measurement based production rates (Oosterschelde: RMSE = 9.7, mean error = 1.5, χ = 0.57; Westerschelde: RMSE = 46.7, mean error = −17.6, χ = 0.9). The relationship between photosynthetic capacity and temperature shows considerable variation and may be improved by using sediment surface temperature instead of ambient temperature. A sensitivity analysis revealed that emersion duration and mud content determine most of the variability in MPB production. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to derive a satellite remote sensing-based overview of average hourly and daily MPB primary production rates at the macro scale. As the proposed model is generic, the model can be applied to other tidal systems to assess spatial variability in MPB primary production at the macro scale after calibration at the site of interest. Model calibration, results and possible applications for regular monitoring of MPB production are discussed below.},

            ABSTRACT
            
              Microbial fermentation is a common form of metabolism that has been exploited by humans to great benefit. Industrial fermentation currently produces a myriad of products ranging from biofuels to pharmaceuticals. About one-third of the world’s food is fermented, and the brewing of fermented beverages in particular has an ancient and storied history. Because fermentation is so intertwined with our daily lives, the topic is easily relatable to students interested in real-world applications for microbiology. Here, we describe the curriculum for a guided inquiry-based laboratory course that combines yeast molecular ecology and brewing. The rationale for the course is to compare commercial
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae
              yeast strains, which have been domesticated through thousands of generations of selection, with wild yeast, where there is growing interest in their potentially unique brewing characteristics. Because wild yeasts are so easy to isolate, identify, and characterize, this is a great opportunity to present key concepts in molecular ecology and genetics in a way that is relevant and accessible to students. We organized the course around three main modules: isolation and identification of wild yeast, phenotypic characterization of wild and commercial ale yeast strains, and scientific design of a brewing recipe and head-to-head comparison of the performance of a commercial and wild yeast strain in the brewing process. Pre- and postassessment showed that students made significant gains in the learning objectives for the course, and students enjoyed connecting microbiology to a real-world application.},

PBAT has been commercialized by polycondensation reaction of butanediol (BDO), adipic acid (AA) and terephthalic acid (PTA) using general polyester manufacturing technology. And it has been considered to have desirable properties and competitive costs to be applied in many fields. Therefore, this review aims to present an overview on the synthesis, properties and applications of PBAT.},

The medium was compared with dichloran-rose bengal medium (DRBC) in an examination of more than 500 specimens of big bale grass silage. Selected characteristics of known fungal species commonly isolated from feeds were examined after growth on MYSA and DRBC and on malt extract agar, used as a noninhibitory control medium. MYSA suppressed bacterial growth, without affecting the growth of fungi common in feeds. The fungi growing on MYSA were easily recognized, and the medium seemed to slow radial growth of fungal colonies, which permitted, easy counting. The number of species found was higher on MYSA than on DRBC. When we compared MYSA with DRBC for mycological examination of grass silage samples, MYSA was found to be the medium of choice.},

Since medium optimization using a one-factor-at-a-time approach is time-consuming, expensive, and often leads to misinterpretation of results, statistical experimental design has been applied to medium optimization for growth and metabolite production [2-5]. In this scenario, the use of mixture design to develop a culture medium containing a cheaper nitrogen source seems to be more appropriate and simple. In this sense, the focus of this work is to present a detailed description of the steps involved in the development of a optimized culture medium containing extruded bean as nitrogen source. •In a previous work we tested a development of new culture media based on the composition of YPD medium, aiming to reduce bioprocess costs as well as to improve the biomass production and heterologous expression.•The developed medium was tested for growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris (GS 115).•The use of culture media containing extruded bean as sole nitrogen source showed better biomass production and protein expression than those observed in the standard YPD medium.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is a critical, non-renewable nutrient; yet excess discharges can lead to eutrophication and deterioration of water quality. Thus, P removal from water must be coupled with P recovery to achieve sustainable P management. P-specific proteins provide a novel, promising approach to recover P from water. Bacterial phosphate-binding proteins (PBPs) are able to effectively remove phosphate, achieving extremely low levels in water (i.e. 0.015 mg-P L−1). A prerequisite of using PBP for P recovery, however, is not only removal, but also controlled P release, which has not yet been reported. Phosphate release using recombinant PBP-expressing Escherichia coli was explored in this study. Escherichia coli was genetically modified to overexpress PBP in the periplasmic space. The impacts of ionic strength, temperature and pH on phosphate release were assessed. PBP-expressed E. coli demonstrated consistently superior ability to adsorb more phosphate from liquid and release more phosphate under controlled conditions relative to negative controls (unexpressed PBP E. coli and E. coli K12). Lower pH (3.8), higher temperature (35ºC) and higher ionic strength (100 mM KCl) facilitated increased phosphate release, providing a maximum of 2.1\% P recovery within 3 h. This study provides proof of concept of the feasibility of using PBP to recover P.},

weather on environmental transmission of diarrhea. Previous studies
have found that high temperatures and heavy precipitation are associated
with increased diarrhea prevalence, but the underlying causal mechanisms

stored drinking water (n = 9692), and hand rinses
from children {\textless}2 years old (n = 2634) with publicly
available gridded temperature and precipitation data (at ≤0.2
degree spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution) by the GPS
coordinates and date of sample collection. Measurements were collected
over a 3-year period across a 2500 km2 area in rural Kenya.
In drinking water sources, high 7-day temperature was associated with
a 0.16 increase in log10E. coli levels
(p {\textless} 0.001, 95\% CI: 0.07, 0.24), while heavy 7-day
total precipitation was associated with a 0.29 increase in log10E. coli levels (p {\textless}

7-day precipitation was associated with a 0.079 increase in log10E. coli levels (p = 0.042,
95\% CI: 0.07, 0.24). Heavy precipitation did not increase E. coli levels among respondents who treated their water,
suggesting that water treatment can mitigate effects on water quality.
On child hands, high 7-day temperature was associated with a 0.39
decrease in log10E. coli levels (p {\textless} 0.001, 95\% CI: −0.52, −0.27). Our findings
provide insight on how climate change could impact environmental transmission
of bacterial pathogens in Kenya. We suggest water treatment is especially
important after heavy precipitation (particularly when preceded by
dry periods) and high temperatures., Weather extremes
may impact transmission of fecally transmitted
pathogens. In Kenya, we showed that high temperature and heavy precipitation
increased fecal bacteria (E. coli) levels in drinking

	abstract = {Fecal coliform bacteria (FCB) contamination of natural waters is a serious public health issue. Therefore, understanding and anticipating the fate and transport of FCB are important for reducing the risk of contracting diseases. The objective of this study was to analyze the impacts of climate change on the fate and transport of FCB. We modified both the soil and the in-stream bacteria modules in the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model and verified the prediction accuracy of seasonal variability of FCB loads using observations. Forty bias-correcting GCM-RCM projections were applied in the modified SWAT model to examine various future climate conditions at the end of this century (2076–2100). Lastly, we also compared the variability of FCB loads under current and future weather conditions using multi-model ensemble simulations (MMES). The modified SWAT model yielded a satisfactory performance with regard to the seasonal variability of FCB amounts in the soil and FCB loading to water bodies. The modified SWAT model presented substantial proliferation of FCB in the soil (30.1\%–147.5\%) due to an increase in temperature (25.1\%). Also, increase in precipitation (53.3\%) led to an increase in FCB loads (96.0\%–115.5\%) from the soil to water body. In the in-stream environment, resuspension from the stream bed was the dominant process affecting the amount of FCB in stream. Therefore, the final FCB loads increased by 71.2\% because of the growing peak channel velocity and volume of water used due to an increase in precipitation. Based on the results of MMES, we concluded that the level of FCB would increase simultaneously in the soil as well as in stream by the end of this century. This study will aid in understanding the future variability of FCB loads as well as in preparing an effective management plan for FCB levels in natural waters.},

Precipitation and flow rate were the controlling parameters influencing coliform dynamics. Correlations were obtained to describe the lake inlet conditions of flow rate, TC and EC. While TC increased with flow rate, EC slightly decreased. This unexpected behaviour for EC was attributed to the counterbalancing impact of coliform loading and surface runoff dilution. Correlations were computed to obtain first-order decay rates of TC and EC as functions of the Reynolds number, assuming the plug-flow model. A general mechanistic-empirical model was proposed to simulate coliform dynamics. The results indicated that seasonal coliform variations are more pronounced than interannual variations. Considering both the plug-flow and complete-mix models, it was shown that eliminating dry weather load reduces TC and EC but still leads to exceedances of the mandatory standards during the rainy season.},

	abstract = {It has been known for some time that substantial populations of fecal coliforms and E. coli are harbored in freshwater bottom sediments, bank soils, and beach sands. However, the relative importance of sediments as bacterial habitats and as a source of water-borne fecal coliforms and E. coli has not been recognized until recently, when a large number of publications have shown that in many cases the resuspension of sediment, rather then runoff from surrounding lands, can create elevated E. coli concentrations in water. This review is an attempt to develop the first comprehensive single source of existing information about fecal coliforms and E. coli in sediments and adjacent soils and to outline the knowledge gaps and research needs. The authors summarize available information on variability and environmental correlations of E. coli and FC concentrations in sediments, genetic diversity of E. coli in sediments, survival of E. coli and FC in sediments, release with resuspended sediment and settling of E. coli and FC, modeling of sediment effects on fate and transport of E. coli in surface waters, and implications for monitoring and management of microbiological water quality. The demonstrated role of pathogenic E. coli strains in food and water quality challenges reinforces the need in better understanding ecological and hydrological factors that affect functioning of sediments as E. coli reservoirs.},

	abstract = {Escherichia coli, a fecal coliform, and total coliforms were monitored between September 1999 and October 2001 in five marinas at Lake Texoma, located on the Oklahoma and Texas border. The general trend was that densities of E. coli were lower in the summer season due to the lower loading of fecal material into Lake Texoma and the ecological conditions of the lake, such as more vigorous grazing by protozoa and less viability of E. coli at an elevated temperature. The densities of total coliforms greatly increased in the summer. E. coli levels increased with depth, and the bottom water samples had higher densities of E. coli mainly due to their association with particles. There was a direct relationship between amount of gasoline sold, which was related to recreational boating activity, and the resuspension of E. coli. This indicated that recreational boating activity in lake marinas may have resuspended bottom sediments with bound E. coli, and the presence of E. coli in marinas was not an indication of recent fecal contamination. E. coli were detected in the largest densities at the boat dock points, followed by the gasoline filling station, and marina entrance. In addition, enumeration of bacteria in bottom sediment showed that the densities of E. coli and total coliforms in sediment were much higher compared to those in lake water.},

The objective of the study was to evaluate the health risks associated with the sources of drinking water in the Dangme West District of Ghana using E. coli as a measurement tool, aiming at ascertaining the paths leading to contamination of the water sources. A total of 464 water samples were obtained for analysis. Sampling covered a year across the dry and wet seasons in Ghana. Water samples were obtained from groundwater and surface water sources. E. coli counts were determined using the most probable number method (MPN). Disease risk assessment was carried out using the WHO drinking water risk assessment guidelines. Generally, the study revealed significantly higher E. coli counts in the wet season than in the dry season. Among the water samples analyzed, surface water, especially from the dams, was found to pose the highest disease risk as compared to the other water sources. Samples from groundwater sources, especially boreholes, posed the lowest disease risk. In conclusion, observations from the study implied that most water sources in the study district are highly polluted with bacteria pathogens beyond recommended safety guidelines. The main causes of faecal contamination in these water sources were purported to be anthropogenic. Therefore, there is a need to formulate a policy aimed at managing and improving rural water sources.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Access to clean water has been identified as one of the primary Sustainable Development Goals. Rapid urbanization is going on in developing nations creating additional pressure on water resources in most of these places which in turn also affects individuals which is largely reliant on proper sanitation and drinking water quality. In addition, open sanitation practice is becoming major public health problem in rural and in some urban areas in India. Groundwater contamination by pathogenic bacteria sourced from both sanitation system and surface water is becoming one of the major concerns now-a-days. The residents of the Ganges river basin in India are already stressed with natural arsenic pollution as well as other various types of water pollution, and microbial pollution from sanitation is a new addition to it. A field-based hydrogeological investigation with the identification of sanitation sites (surface and subsurface) was conducted in some parts of the Ganges basin, in and around a lower order distributary river, River Churni in West Bengal state, to identify the natural and human influences on sanitation drinking water pollution in a highly populated part of South Asia. Groundwater was found to be contaminated severely with total (TC) and fecal (FC) coliform bacteria. The abundance of TC was found to be the highest in monsoon season (78\%) than in pre-monsoon (48\%) and post-monsoon (29\%) seasons. The results revealed that the groundwater samples from shallow depths and close to sanitation sites were highly contaminated with coliform bacteria than the deeper and higher distant (\&gt;30 m distance) ones. Shallow groundwater samples near to surface water (River Churni) source, other than sanitation sites, showed elevated TC levels. The occurrence of coliform bacteria in studied groundwater samples was observed to be positively correlated with conductivity, TDS, TOC, chloride, and sulfate, while the abundance was restricted by pH and temperature of groundwater. Thus, improper sanitation systems and contaminated surface water were identified as one of the major sources of pathogenic contamination of groundwater-sourced drinking water in the studied area, whereas improper human practices further complicate the scenario which needs to be managed properly.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

They have been detected in many marine species, but also in drinking water and in numerous foods, such as salt, honey and marine organisms. Exposure to microplastics can also occur through inhaled air. Data from animal studies have shown that once absorbed, plastic micro- and nanoparticles can distribute to the liver, spleen, heart, lungs, thymus, reproductive organs, kidneys and even the brain (crosses the blood–brain barrier). In addition, microplastics are transport operators of persistent organic pollutants or heavy metals from invertebrate organisms to other higher trophic levels. After ingestion, the additives and monomers in their composition can interfere with important biological processes in the human body and can cause disruption of the endocrine, immune system; can have a negative impact on mobility, reproduction and development; and can cause carcinogenesis. The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has affected not only human health and national economies but also the environment, due to the large volume of waste in the form of discarded personal protective equipment. The remarkable increase in global use of face masks, which mainly contain polypropylene, and poor waste management have led to worsening microplastic pollution, and the long-term consequences can be extremely devastating if urgent action is not taken.},

	abstract = {Plastic pollution is a significant problem worldwide because of the risks it poses to the equilibrium and health of the environment as well as to human beings. Discarded plastic released into the environment can degrade into microplastics (MPs) due to various factors, such as sunlight, seawater flow, and temperature. MP surfaces can act as solid scaffolds for microorganisms, viruses, and various biomolecules (such as LPS, allergens, and antibiotics), depending on the MP characteristics of size/surface area, chemical composition, and surface charge. The immune system has efficient recognition and elimination mechanisms for pathogens, foreign agents, and anomalous molecules, including pattern recognition receptors and phagocytosis. However, associations with MPs can modify the physical, structural, and functional characteristics of microbes and biomolecules, thereby changing their interactions with the host immune system (in particular with innate immune cells) and, most likely, the features of the subsequent innate/inflammatory response. Thus, exploring differences in the immune response to microbial agents that have been modified by interactions with MPs is meaningful in terms of identifying new possible risks to human health posed by anomalous stimulation of immune reactivities.},

	abstract = {Plastic waste has gained remarkable research attention due to its accumulation, associated environmental issues, and impact on living organisms. In order to overcome this challenge, there is an urgent need for its removal from the environment. Under this menace, finding appropriate treatment methods like biodegradation instead of typical treatment methods is of supreme importance. However, there is a limited review on bio-decomposition of plastics, existing microbial species, their degradation efficacy, and mechanism. From this point of view, this study focused on a brief overview of biodegradation such as influencing factors on biodegradation, existing species for macro- and micro-plastics, and present research gap. Degradation percentage, limitations of existing species, and future recommendations are proposed. Microbial species such as bacteria, algae, and fungi have the ability to decompose plastics but they are unable to completely mineralize the plastics. Meanwhile, there is limited knowledge about the involved enzymes in plastics degradation, especially in the case of algae. Bio-decomposition of plastics requires more stringent conditions which are usually feasible for field application. This work will be a reference for new researchers to use this effective strategy for plastic pollution removal.},

	abstract = {Plastic polymers are non-degradable solid wastes that have become a great threat to the whole world and degradation of these plastics would take a few decades. Compared with other degradation processes, the biodegradation process is the most effective and best way for plastic degradation due to its non-polluting mechanism, eco-friendly nature, and cost-effectiveness. Biodegradation of synthetic plastics is a very slow process that also involves environmental factors and the action of wild microbial species. In this plastic biodegradation, fungi play a pivotal role, it acts on plastics by secreting some degrading enzymes, i.e., cutinase`, lipase, and proteases, lignocellulolytic enzymes, and also the presence of some pro-oxidant ions can cause effective degradation. The oxidation or hydrolysis by the enzyme creates functional groups that improve the hydrophilicity of polymers, and consequently degrade the high molecular weight polymer into low molecular weight. This leads to the degradation of plastics within a few days. Some well-known species which show effective degradation on plastics are Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus glaucus, Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus nomius, Penicillium griseofulvum, Bjerkandera adusta, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Cladosporium cladosporioides, etc., and some other saprotrophic fungi, such as Pleurotus abalones, Pleurotus ostreatus, Agaricus bisporus and Pleurotus eryngii which also helps in degradation of plastics by growing on them. Some studies say that the degradation of plastics was more effective when photodegradation and thermo-oxidative mechanisms involved with the biodegradation simultaneously can make the degradation faster and easier. This present review gives current knowledge regarding different species of fungi that are involved in the degradation of plastics by their different enzymatic mechanisms to degrade different forms of plastic polymers.},

Today, less than 50 verified plastics-active enzymes are known. First examples of enzymes acting on the polymers polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyurethane (PUR) have been reported together with a detailed biochemical and structural description. Furthermore, very few polyamide (PA) oligomer active enzymes are known. In this article, the current known enzymes acting on the synthetic polymers PET and PUR are briefly summarized, their published activity data were collected and integrated into a comprehensive open access database. The Plastics-Active Enzymes Database (PAZy) represents an inventory of known and experimentally verified enzymes that act on synthetic fossil fuel-based polymers. Almost 3000 homologs of PET-active enzymes were identified by profile hidden Markov models. Over 2000 homologs of PUR-active enzymes were identified by BLAST. Based on multiple sequence alignments, conservation analysis identified the most conserved amino acids, and sequence motifs for PET- and PUR-active enzymes were derived.},

	abstract = {Traditional plastics, such as polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyurethane (PUR), and other plastic polymers, are difficult to degrade and are gradually accumulated in the environment to cause a serious environmental problem, which is urgently needed to develop novel treatments or control technology. The biodegradation of plastics has gained great attention due to the advantages of green and safe characteristics. Microorganisms play a vital role in the biodegradation of plastics, including environmental microbes (
              in vitro
              ) and gut microbes of insects (
              in vivo
              ). Microbial degradation in environmental conditions
              in vitro
              is extremely slow for major plastics at degradation rates on the basis of a month or even a year time, but recent discoveries show that the fast biodegradation of specific plastics, such as PS, PE, and PUR, in some invertebrates, especially insects, could be enhanced at rates on basis of hours; the biodegradation in insects is likely to be gut microbial-dependent or synergetic bioreactions in animal digestive systems. This review comprehensively summarizes the latest 7-year (2016–2022) publications on plastic biodegradation by insects and microorganisms, elucidates the mechanism of plastic degradation in insects and environmental microbes, and highlights the cutting-edge perspectives for the potential applications of plastic biodegradation.},
