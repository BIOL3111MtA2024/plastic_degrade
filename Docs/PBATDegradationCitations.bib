	abstract = {Enumeration and isolation of polylactic acid (PLA)-degrading bacteria from soils and wastewater sludge were performed on emulsified PLA agar. Two isolates of potent PLA-degrading bacteria, designated as CH1 and WS3, were selected and identified as Stenotrophomonas pavanii and Pseudomonas geniculata, respectively. PLA was presented as a substrate to stimulate production of protease and PLA-degrading enzyme by S. pavanii CH1 and P. geniculata WS3. The optimal pH values for both protease and PLA-degrading enzyme production by S. pavanii CH1 and P. geniculata WS3 were 7.5 and 8.0, respectively. The optimal gelatin concentrations for stimulating protease production in S. pavanii CH1 and P. geniculata WS3 were 0.3\% (w/v), while those for PLA-degrading enzyme production in S. pavanii CH1 and P. geniculata WS3 were 0.1 and 0.3\% (w/v), respectively. In addition, P. geniculata WS3 had a higher percentage of PLA film-weight loss than that of S. pavanii CH1, corresponding with reduced molecular weight of PLA. A significant increase of lactic acid content in culture broth was directly correlated with the increasing percentage of PLA film-weight loss. Our results clearly demonstrated that P. geniculata WS3, a novel isolated bacterium, has played a substantial role in PLA biodegradation by producing PLA-degrading enzyme and adhering on PLA surface.},

	abstract = {Bio-plastics have gained tremendous attention, due to the increasing environmental pressure on global warming and plastic pollution. Among them, poly (lactic acid) (PLA) is both bio-based and bio-degradable, which has been widely used in many disposable packaging applications. The global market for PLA demand doubles every 3–4 years, as estimated by Jem's law. Compared to traditional petroleum-based plastics, PLA is more expensive and usually has less mechanical and physical properties. The recent compounding efforts and the commercialization of D(−) lactic acid and its polymer PDLA have the potential to improve the mechanical and thermal characteristics of PLA (e.g. by forming stereocomplex PLA) for applications in high-end markets. However, the usage of PLA in some other applications is still limited. With a structure similar to PLA, poly (glycolic acid) (PGA) has promising characteristics such as good biodegradability and barrier properties, which is potentially a beneficial supplement to PLA. The modification of PLA with PGA can be achieved via co-polymerization, physical blending and multilayer lamination. PGA and its combination with PLA have been widely studied in bio-medical applications, but not been well developed at large scales due to its relatively high production cost. In this case, the development of novel production technology and the advent of government regulations are the key drivers for the global transition towards bioplastics. Recently, multiple governmental regulations have been released that restrict the use of traditional plastics and facilitate bio-degradable plastic applications. PGA can be derived from industrial waste gases using an innovative production technology, which reduces carbon emissions and its production cost. By developing the production and compounding technology, PGA can be combined with PLA to play an essential role for a sustainable and environmental friendly plastic industry, especially for single-used products requiring fast degradation at room temperature or in the nature environment.},

Their growth and formation of biofilm on PLA was characterized. To establish the biodegradation role of these bacteria and to assess any possible influence of abiotic factors in the biodegradation of PLA at 30 °C, the biodegradation rate of each strain was measured as the reduction of weight average molecular number (Mn) of PLA. A rapid reduction of PLA Mn was observed when incubated with each strain. Abiotic controls showed very slow degradation rates. Only the P. aeruginosa isolates were able to grow on lactate suggesting that there is a novel mechanism for degradation by Chryseobacterium sp. and Sphingobacterium sp. All four strains were capable of forming biofilm on the surface of PLA films consistent with the observed polymer degradation. This comparative study establishes the role of these isolates in the degradation of PLA at ambient temperature with minimal assistance from abiotic factors.},

	abstract = {Polylactic acid (PLA) is the most commonly used biodegradable polymer in clinical applications today. Examples range from drug delivery systems, tissue engineering, temporary and long-term implantable devices; constantly expanding to new fields. This is owed greatly to the polymer's favorable biocompatibility and to its safe degradation products. Once coming in contact with biological media, the polymer begins breaking down, usually by hydrolysis, into lactic acid (LA) or to carbon dioxide and water. These products are metabolized intracellularly or excreted in the urine and breath. Bacterial infection and foreign-body inflammation enhance the breakdown of PLA, through the secretion of enzymes that degrade the polymeric matrix., The biodegradation occurs both on the surface of the polymeric device and inside the polymer body, by diffusion of water between the polymer chains., The median half-life of the polymer is 30 weeks; however, this can be lengthened or shortened to address the clinical needs. Degradation kinetics can be tuned by determining the molecular composition and the physical architecture of the device. Using L- or D- chirality of the LA will greatly slow or lengthen the degradation rates, respectively., Despite the fact that this polymer is more than 150 years old, PLA remains a fertile platform for biomedical innovation and fundamental understanding of how artificial polymers can safely coexist with biological systems.},

Additional tests can categorize the organisms phenotypically using fatty acid methyl ester, SDS-PAGE, or MALDI-TOF. New methods with molecular approach based on sequences of specific genes may aid genomic differentiation and precise identification.

	abstract = {Microplastics are small plastic particles that come from the degradation of plastics, ubiquitous in nature and therefore affect both wildlife and humans. They have been detected in many marine species, but also in drinking water and in numerous foods, such as salt, honey and marine organisms. Exposure to microplastics can also occur through inhaled air. Data from animal studies have shown that once absorbed, plastic micro- and nanoparticles can distribute to the liver, spleen, heart, lungs, thymus, reproductive organs, kidneys and even the brain (crosses the blood–brain barrier). In addition, microplastics are transport operators of persistent organic pollutants or heavy metals from invertebrate organisms to other higher trophic levels. After ingestion, the additives and monomers in their composition can interfere with important biological processes in the human body and can cause disruption of the endocrine, immune system; can have a negative impact on mobility, reproduction and development; and can cause carcinogenesis. The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has affected not only human health and national economies but also the environment, due to the large volume of waste in the form of discarded personal protective equipment. The remarkable increase in global use of face masks, which mainly contain polypropylene, and poor waste management have led to worsening microplastic pollution, and the long-term consequences can be extremely devastating if urgent action is not taken.},

	abstract = {Plastic pollution is a significant problem worldwide because of the risks it poses to the equilibrium and health of the environment as well as to human beings. Discarded plastic released into the environment can degrade into microplastics (MPs) due to various factors, such as sunlight, seawater flow, and temperature. MP surfaces can act as solid scaffolds for microorganisms, viruses, and various biomolecules (such as LPS, allergens, and antibiotics), depending on the MP characteristics of size/surface area, chemical composition, and surface charge. The immune system has efficient recognition and elimination mechanisms for pathogens, foreign agents, and anomalous molecules, including pattern recognition receptors and phagocytosis. However, associations with MPs can modify the physical, structural, and functional characteristics of microbes and biomolecules, thereby changing their interactions with the host immune system (in particular with innate immune cells) and, most likely, the features of the subsequent innate/inflammatory response. Thus, exploring differences in the immune response to microbial agents that have been modified by interactions with MPs is meaningful in terms of identifying new possible risks to human health posed by anomalous stimulation of immune reactivities.},

In order to overcome this challenge, there is an urgent need for its removal from the environment. Under this menace, finding appropriate treatment methods like biodegradation instead of typical treatment methods is of supreme importance. However, there is a limited review on bio-decomposition of plastics, existing microbial species, their degradation efficacy, and mechanism. From this point of view, this study focused on a brief overview of biodegradation such as influencing factors on biodegradation, existing species for macro- and micro-plastics, and present research gap. Degradation percentage, limitations of existing species, and future recommendations are proposed. Microbial species such as bacteria, algae, and fungi have the ability to decompose plastics but they are unable to completely mineralize the plastics. Meanwhile, there is limited knowledge about the involved enzymes in plastics degradation, especially in the case of algae. Bio-decomposition of plastics requires more stringent conditions which are usually feasible for field application.

In this plastic biodegradation, fungi play a pivotal role, it acts on plastics by secreting some degrading enzymes, i.e., cutinase`, lipase, and proteases, lignocellulolytic enzymes, and also the presence of some pro-oxidant ions can cause effective degradation. The oxidation or hydrolysis by the enzyme creates functional groups that improve the hydrophilicity of polymers, and consequently degrade the high molecular weight polymer into low molecular weight. This leads to the degradation of plastics within a few days. Some well-known species which show effective degradation on plastics are Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus glaucus, Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus nomius, Penicillium griseofulvum, Bjerkandera adusta, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Cladosporium cladosporioides, etc., and some other saprotrophic fungi, such as Pleurotus abalones, Pleurotus ostreatus, Agaricus bisporus and Pleurotus eryngii which also helps in degradation of plastics by growing on them. Some studies say that the degradation of plastics was more effective when photodegradation and thermo-oxidative mechanisms involved with the biodegradation simultaneously can make the degradation faster and easier. This present review gives current knowledge regarding different species of fungi that are involved in the degradation of plastics by their different enzymatic mechanisms to degrade different forms of plastic polymers.},

Today, less than 50 verified plastics-active enzymes are known. First examples of enzymes acting on the polymers polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyurethane (PUR) have been reported together with a detailed biochemical and structural description. Furthermore, very few polyamide (PA) oligomer active enzymes are known. In this article, the current known enzymes acting on the synthetic polymers PET and PUR are briefly summarized, their published activity data were collected and integrated into a comprehensive open access database. The Plastics-Active Enzymes Database (PAZy) represents an inventory of known and experimentally verified enzymes that act on synthetic fossil fuel-based polymers. Almost 3000 homologs of PET-active enzymes were identified by profile hidden Markov models. Over 2000 homologs of PUR-active enzymes were identified by BLAST. Based on multiple sequence alignments, conservation analysis identified the most conserved amino acids, and sequence motifs for PET- and PUR-active enzymes were derived.},

	abstract = {Traditional plastics, such as polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyurethane (PUR), and other plastic polymers, are difficult to degrade and are gradually accumulated in the environment to cause a serious environmental problem, which is urgently needed to develop novel treatments or control technology. The biodegradation of plastics has gained great attention due to the advantages of green and safe characteristics. Microorganisms play a vital role in the biodegradation of plastics, including environmental microbes (
              in vitro
              ) and gut microbes of insects (
              in vivo
              ). Microbial degradation in environmental conditions
              in vitro
              is extremely slow for major plastics at degradation rates on the basis of a month or even a year time, but recent discoveries show that the fast biodegradation of specific plastics, such as PS, PE, and PUR, in some invertebrates, especially insects, could be enhanced at rates on basis of hours; the biodegradation in insects is likely to be gut microbial-dependent or synergetic bioreactions in animal digestive systems. This review comprehensively summarizes the latest 7-year (2016–2022) publications on plastic biodegradation by insects and microorganisms, elucidates the mechanism of plastic degradation in insects and environmental microbes, and highlights the cutting-edge perspectives for the potential applications of plastic biodegradation.},
