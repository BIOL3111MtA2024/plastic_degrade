# Project Title

## Summary

Producers of bioplastics often claim that their polymers are biodegradable, but that claim is seldom true excluding under industrial composting conditions. In our investigation of the microbial degradation of bioplastics, we secured fragments of vegetable starch-based dog poop bags in tubes across 2 photobioreactors set to 15 and 25ï‚°C respectively. In each photobioreactor were 3 controls: one containing plastic but omitting nutrient and pond microbes, another containing plastic and nutrient but omitting pond microbes, and a third containing pond microbes and nutrient but no plastic. Following a 4-week trial period, we observed no statistically significant relationship between microbe presence, nutrient presence, or temperature and percent mass decrease in bioplastics. This result comes as no surprise, given that studies such as ours ordinarily cover far longer periods of time.

### Data/RawData

Raw data files in various formats. Original files generated by analytical equipment, received from a data provider or outside contractor, etc.
Subfolders contain files from a single instrument.
Do not create swarms of superfluous sub-folders.

### Data/CleanData

Clean data in formats for long-term storage. Modified data with the appropriate column/row headers and data structure.

### Data/ProcessedData

Processed data in formats for long-term storage.

### Code

Scripts for processing raw data into cleaned data, outside derived code, and user derived code.
A folder OldR is used to store outdated code.
Typically organize .Rmd in modules; Import; Tidy; Process saving .Rds out of each step.

### Docs

Project notes, other documentation, etc.

### Output

Output from knit .Rmd, Figures and tables produced from analysis.
Do not generate swarms of superfluous data exploration figures.
